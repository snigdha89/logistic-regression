# logistic-regression

Implement a logistic regression classifier. As before, use year 1 labels as training set and predict year 2 labels. For each week,your feature set is (mu; sigma) for that week. Use your labels (you will have 52 weekly labels per year) from year 1 to train your classifier and predict labels for year 2.
Questions:
1. what is the equation for logistic regression that your classifier found from year 1 data?
2. what is the accuracy for year 2?
3. compute the confusion matrix for year 2
4. what is true positive rate (sensitivity or recall) and true negative rate (specificity) for year 2?
5. implement a trading strategy based on your labels for year 2 and compare the performance with the "buy-and-hold" strategy. Which strategy results in a larger amount at the end of the year?
